/*
 * The touch panel's geometry: what each control's shape is, and what a touch at
 * a point lands on. Plain C over libm, no LVGL, so host/panel.sh compiles it as
 * is -- and the same functions both paint a control and hit-test it, so what is
 * drawn is exactly what can be touched.
 *
 * The visual language comes from Ed's reference sheet ("ESP32 Round Display
 * UI.pdf", 1:1 device pixels): buttons fill a disc inset 34 px from the panel
 * edge, split by 36 px gaps, every corner rounded to 8 px.
 *
 * Coordinates are screen pixels, (0,0) top left. Pass a pixel's CENTRE
 * (x + 0.5, y + 0.5) when painting.
